## What I Learned

This project helped refine my understanding of:

- Structuring accessible and visually appealing profile cards.
- Using `Flexbox` for vertical alignment and spacing.
- Implementing smooth hover effects for interactive elements.

Here's a snippet showcasing the hover effect for the social links:

```css
.sm-link:hover {
    background-color: #c4f82a;
    color: #333;
}
```
